# Star Fox 64 Score Tracker
The Star Fox 64 Score Tracker is a tool I created for the Star Fox 64 score running Discord community [HIT + 64](https://discord.gg/k2JnzC4). The program is heavily inspired by the speedrunning tool LiveSplit and is intended to not only be used for personal tracking but to be incorporated into streaming layouts to provide viewers with an indication of how well a run is going.

# Whats New?

### Last Updated: 5/3/2019

- Tired of the tracker reminding you you have updates? Well now the tracker has a brand new update notification window. 
- From the new update window you can now skip an update.
- You can also just download the update from the update window and be up to date. :)
- If you were fine with the tracker reminding you every time you run it that there is an update thats still an option too.
- Added multi-file support to allow for more than 2 routes. (adding new files requires manually editing config.ini at this time)
- Now when you are comparing against Sum of Best the Top/Comparison line will display a - for the label and score. Open to feedback on this one but didn't like the previous way it was handled.

# How to update?
The tracker will always be backwards compatible with previous config and score tracking files. Simply replace the executable of the file you are currently using with the new one linked above and it will function with all of the same files generated by the old copy of the program. 

# Running on Linux
This program is written in C# which is a Microsoft programming language and doesn't really port super well to other operating systems. This program is however tested and compatible with mono for linux. The package you need on Debian / Ubuntu based systems is mono-complete and the command to run the program assuming you cant just opening from your file browsing program is mono SF64ScoreTracker.exe
